# Ingredients
- 2 cups shredded chicken breast (bones and skin removed)
- 1 tsp parsley
- 1 tsp rosemary
- 1 tsp thyme
- 8 oz cream cheese (softened)
- &frac12; cup Frank's Red Hot
- &frac12; cup ranch
- 1 block (roughly 6 oz) cheddar cheese (freshly grated)
- Optional:
    - &frac12; cup blue cheese crumbles

# Instructions
1. To a medium pot, add the parsley, rosemary, and thyme and bring to a simmer.
1. Place chicken in water, cover with lid, and leave for 45-60 minutes. ***[1]***
1. Remove chicken from the pot and shred it using whatever works. ***[2]***
1. Mix together cream cheese, hot sauce, and ranch.
1. Mix in chicken.
1. Mix in half of the grated cheddar cheese and the blue cheese crumbles if you opted for using them.
1. Add the mixture to a small oven-safe dish and bake at 325&deg;F for 8 minutes.
1. Remove from the oven, top with the remaining half of the grated cheddar cheese, and cook in the oven for another 5 minutes. ***[3]***
1. Serve.

1. A convenient method for this is just preheating the oven to 325&deg;F and after the water comes to a boil, put it in said oven. This will maintain the slow cooking temperature more consistently than the stove will.
1. Something that works for me is setting the cooked chicken breast on a cutting board and scraping it with the backside of a fork against the grain.
1. You can cook it longer if you want but if you cook it too hot or too long the cheese might split and the top layer of cheese might seize up after cooling.
