# Ingredients
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 2 cups shredded chicken breast (bones and skin removed)
- salt
- 1 tsp parsley
- 1 tsp rosemary
- 1 tsp thyme
- 8 oz cream cheese (softened)
- &frac12; cup Frank's Red Hot
- &frac12; cup ranch
- 6 oz of sharp cheddar cheese (grated)
- 1 jalapeno (quartered and thinly sliced)
- Optional:
    - &frac12; cup blue cheese crumbles

# Instructions
1. Salt the chicken on both sides.
1. To a medium pot on medium-high heat, add the olive oil and sear the chicken on both sides.
1. Add the parsley, rosemary, and thyme. Add enough water to cover the chicken and bring to a simmer.
1. Cook on medium-low until the chicken is pull-apart tender (~1-2 hours).
1. Remove chicken from the pot and shred it using whatever works.[^2]
1. Mix together cream cheese, hot sauce, jalapeno, the bulb of the green onion, and ranch.
1. Mix in chicken.
1. Mix in half of the grated cheddar cheese and the blue cheese crumbles if you opted for using them.
1. Add the mixture to a small oven-safe dish and bake at 325&deg;F for 8 minutes.
1. Remove from the oven, top with the remaining half of the grated cheddar cheese and the stem of the green onion and cook in the oven for another 5 minutes.[^3]
1. Serve.

[^1]: A convenient method for this is just preheating the oven to 325&deg;F and after the water comes to a boil, put it in said oven. This will maintain the slow cooking temperature more consistently than the stove will.
[^2]: Something that works for me is setting the cooked chicken breast on a cutting board and scraping it with the backside of a fork against the grain.
[^3]: You can cook it longer if you want but if you cook it too hot or too long the cheese might split and the top layer of cheese might seize up after cooling.
