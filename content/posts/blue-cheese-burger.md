# Ingredients
- 1 lb ground beef (20%+ fat)
- hamburger buns
- 1 jalapeno (sliced, &frac18; inch)
- yellow onion (sliced as thin as you can)
- &frac13; cup of blue cheese crumbles
    - if you're using a solid block, cut off enough to stack on a burger about &frac14; inch high
- blackened seasoning
- buffalo sauce of choice
- salt & pepper

# Instructions
1. On medium heat, toast the inner side of the buns with olive oil. About 2&frac12;-3 minutes is usually enough.
1. Increase pan heat to med-high. Season your patty generously with salt and pepper, place on the skillet, and top with the sliced onions.
1. Aggressively press the patty onto the skillet (onions should be pressed into the burger by doing this). Cook for 1&frac12; minutes.
1. Flip. Top with jalapenos,followed by blue cheese. Cover and cook for 1 minute.[^1]
1. Apply blackened seasoning (enough to cover). Cover and cook for 30 seconds.[^2]
1. Place patty on bun, top with however much buffalo sauce you want, let rest for 2 minutes, serve.

[^1]: Optional: Fry the jalapeno slices first by dredging them and frying in shallow oil. Alternatively you can just sautee them for a minute or two with a bit of oil on medium.
[^2]: Optional: Put a bit of [Phisch's BBQ Sauce](phisch-bbq-sauce.html) on the bottom bun.
