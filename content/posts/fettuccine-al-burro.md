# Ingredients
- 100g of fettuccine pasta (dry)
    - reserve pasta water
- 2 tbsp of butter
- &frac12; cup of pecorino romano (fine grated + additional for garnish)
    - subst: parmigiano reggiano

# Instructions
1. Slice butter into smaller pieces and place in medium sized bowl.
1. In large pot bring water to boil, add salt to taste, and cook pasta al dente.
1. After pasta is done take a mug and collect some of the pasta water. Drain the remainder and add pasta to bowl with butter.
1. Toss pasta until butter has melted completely.
1. In small batches, add cheese while tossing, adding pasta water if it looks like the mix has gotten too dry.
1. Add ground pepper to taste, toss.
1. Serve in bowl or on plate and garnish with additional cheese and pepper.

1. Traditionally the recipe doesn't call for black pepper but I add it as a personal touch at the very end.
