    - subst: water
- 1 tbsp of cold butter

# Instructions
1.  Cook meat to desired doneness. Set aside, reserving oil/grease/broth from cooking. Let rest for at least 15 minutes.
1. In pan on medium heat, pour in sauce and add shallot. Sautee until shallot is softened.
1. Increase heat to medium-high and add wine while scraping the bottom of the pan. Reduce for about 1-2 minutes.
1. Reduce heat to medium-low and add stock. Reduce until thickened.***- [3]***
1. Turn off heat, add butter to pan, and whisk until butter has completely dissolved. ***- [4]***
1. Add any juices that accumulated from the steak resting.
1. Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve immediately.
    - Optional: you may strain the sauce to obtain a more uniform texture, though it is not necessary.

1. Any aromatic vegetables (onion, garlic, celery, etc.) can be substituted or combined in place of the shallot.
1. This sauce is incredibly versatile and can be adjusted into one of many named sauces by modifying the ingredients.
1. &frac14; cup of cream can be mixed in after the sauce thickens in step 4. This creates an extremely rich and dense sauce, with a brighter color.
1. Any acid or chopped fresh herbs can be added just after whisking in the butter to brighten up the sauce.
