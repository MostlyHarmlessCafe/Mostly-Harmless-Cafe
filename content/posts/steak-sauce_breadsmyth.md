### Notes from the contributor
{{<footnote "1" "Any aromatic vegetables (onion, garlic, celery, etc.) can be substituted or combined in place of the shallot.">}}
{{<footnote "2" "This sauce is incredibly versatile and can be adjusted into one of many named sauces by modifying the ingredients.">}}
{{<footnote "3" "&frac14; cup of cream can be mixed in after the sauce thickens in step 4. This creates an extremely rich and dense sauce, with a brighter color.">}}
{{<footnote "4" "Any acid or chopped fresh herbs can be added just after whisking in the butter to brighten up the sauce.">}}
