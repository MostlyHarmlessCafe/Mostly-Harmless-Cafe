This recipe is going to make enough pork, chimichurri, and onions for a lot of tacos. Anything you don't use you can put in a deli container or whatever works and it will only get better the longer you keep it.

# Ingredients
- Pork (+marinade):
    - 1 pork loin 
    - Salt (enough to cover)
    - Pepper (enough to cover)
    - Lime juice
    - Soy sauce
- Pork sauce:
    - 2 tbsp white vinegar
    - 1 tbsp water
    - black pepper
    - 2 tbsp butter
    - &frac14; cup heavy cream
    - juice of &frac14; lime
    - salt to taste
- Tacos
    - cilantro
    - asiago cheese
    - clarified butter
    - [Pickled red onions](pickled-red-onions.html)
    - [Chimichurri](chimichurri.html)

# Instructions
- Pork:
    1. To the pork loin, generously cover with and rub in the salt and pepper.
    1. Place the pork in a ziploc bag (or any container) and fill with equal parts soy sauce and lime juice (enough to submerge). Let marinate for at least an hour.
    1. Remove the pork loin from the marinade and pat dry.
    1. To a heavy-bottom pot or pan on medium-high heat, add clarified butter.
    1. In the pan, sear the pork loin on all sides and then set the pork loin to the side.
- Pork sauce:
    1. Mix the vinegar and water together and add to the pan, aggressively scraping the bottom of the pan as to free up the fond.
    1. Reduce heat to medium.
    1. Add butter, cream, lime, and pepper to the pan. Mix everything together.
        - If you'd like, you can let this reduce, just be careful not to overheat it.
        - Add more cream to make the flavor less harsh and more rounded. Add less to make it stronger and mildly bitter.
    1. Season to taste with salt and set aside.
- Pork:
    1. Slice a 1-inch cutlet out of your pork loin short-ways.
    1. To a pan on medium-high heat, some clarified butter and sear the pork on both sides.
    1. Remove from the pan and let sit for 5 minutes.
    1. Slice the cutlet up into thin strips, about &frac18;-inch thick.

1. How much lime juice and soy sauce you use is up to you. I prefer a 1:1 ratio of each. The important thing is that you give it enough to cover it while it's soaking in the bag or whatever container you're marinating it in.
2. You can also use a large tortilla and go for more of a burrito but I personally like using small tortillas because they're more fun.
