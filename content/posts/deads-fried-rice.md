# Ingredients
- Rice:
    - 100g of jasmine rice (uncooked)
    - 100g of water[^1]
    - vegetable oil
    - 3 eggs (scrambled)
    - 1 medium red onion (finely diced)
    - 1 inch knob of ginger (minced)
    - 2 cloves of garlic (minced)
    - 1 tbsp sesame oil
    - 1 tbsp chili oil
    - 1 tbsp cilantro (minced)
    - 1 green onion (thinly sliced)
- Sauce:
    - 2 tbsp soy sauce
    - 1 tbsp oyster sauce
    - &frac12; tbsp lime juice

# Instructions
1. Add rice and water to rice cooker. Cook to completion and spread over a plate before putting it in the fridge to be chilled.
1. To a small bowl, add all of the sauce ingredients and stir to combine. Set aside.
1. To a wok on medium-high heat, add the vegetable. When the oil starts smoking, add the egg.
1. Cook until the egg is done, chop it up with the spatula, add it to a bowl and set it to the side.
1. Add oil to wok and reduce to medium-low heat.
1. Add the onion. Cook until translucent.
1. Add garlic and ginger. Cook until fragrent.
1. Increase heat to medium-high and add cooked rice. Stir and toss throughout the cooking process.
1. Cook for about 30 seconds and then add the sesame oil and chili oil. Continue tossing and stiring.
1. Add the sauce by streaming it down the sides of the wok. Immediately resume mixing the rice.
1. Add the cilantro and green onion. Mix for another minute and then pour into a bowl for serving.

[^1]: I know it probably seems weird to measure water out for rice like this but a 1:1 ratio of dry rice to water gives the best result when the rice is going to be fried soon thereafter.
