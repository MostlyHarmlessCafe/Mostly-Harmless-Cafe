description: The joke is that they're so spicy that they'll sober you up; alternatively, you can say they're so spicy they'll cure your hangover. This is a spicy, salty, and mildly sweet dish with licorice notes from anise seed and Thai basil.

    - 1 inch knob of ginger (minced)
    - 3 shallots (thinly sliced longways)
    - 2 scallions (sliced, 1-inch slices)
    - 7 Thai red chili peppers (thinly sliced)
        - use more if you want it to be spicier
    - 1 cup Thai basil
    - 2 tbsp Shaoxing wine
        - subst: chinkiang vinegar or rice vinegar
    - 2 tbsp chili oil
- Beef:
    - 1&frac12; lbs beef (cut into bite size pieces)
    - &frac12; tsp salt
    - &frac14; cup soy sauce
    - 1 tsp ground anise seed
- Sauce:
    - 2 tbsp brown sugar
    - 2 tbsp soy sauce
    - 2 tbsp dark soy sauce
    - 3 tbsp fish sauce
    - 2 tbsp oyster sauce
    - 1 tsp ground white pepper

# Instructions
1. Mix beef with salt, anise, and soy sauce. Let marinate until needed.
1. Ideally, do this just before soaking the noodles so that by the time the noodles are ready the beef has been soaking for about an hour.
1. Prepare noodles using instructions on box/bag.
1. This may take up to an hour so go ahead and prep all the other ingredients after this is done.
1. Prepare sauce by mixing all sauce ingredients together and setting to the side.
1. **Wait for noodles to finish soaking and beef to finish marinating before proceeding.**
1. Set wok on med-high heat add oil and sear the beef. Don't cook all the way, just long enough to sear. This takes around 1 minute per side. Remove beef and set aside.
    - Additional oil may be needed between batches.
1. Reduce heat to medium and add shallots and ginger. Cook until slightly soft and then add Shaoxing wine. After adding the wine, scrape the bottom of the pan to loosen any fonde.
1. Add the garlic, chilis, scallions and beef. Stir in.
1. Add noodles. Continuously mix until noodles wilt enough that they're pleasant to bite into. Then add the sauce and mix it in.[^1]
1. Add basil. Cook while mixing until basil is slightly wilted.
1. Add chili oil and mix for 30 more seconds.
1. Serve.[^2][^3]

[^1]: Depending on how comfortable you are with tossing in a wok/pan, you may want to use a spatula or tongs until the noodles become more limp. After being soaked the noodles can sometimes still be sort of like ribbons and unwieldy. Be careful not to overwork the noodles or they might break.
[^2]: If you get to the end and find it's still not spicy enough, add more chili oil.
[^3]: When reheating, heat skillet to medium-high, add 1 tbsp of chili oil, add desired amount of noodles, and toss until heated. This is better than microwaving.
