# Ingredients
- 1 cup of cranberries (fresh or frozen)
- &frac14; cup of water
- 1 tbsp of brown sugar
- 1 tsp of ground nutmeg

# Instructions
1. To a sauce pan on medium heat, add the cranberries and water. Bring to a simmer.
1. Add the brown sugar and stir in.
1. Let simmer until most of the water has evaporated. This is when bubbles start forming at the top and the cranberries have become soft.[^1]
1. Add the nutmeg and gently stir to combine.
1. Serve.

[^1]: The more you work the cranberries while they're cooking, the more they'll lose their form and become mushy.
