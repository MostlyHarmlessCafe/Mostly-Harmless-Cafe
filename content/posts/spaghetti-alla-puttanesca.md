Puttanesca is a briny tomato-based sauce used for pasta among other things. The approach is very from the hip and can include whatever else might taste good. It can be used with pasta, served on chicken, topped on a croquette, etc. This recipe includes the whole pound of pasta but I've found it makes more sense to make the sauce, store it in a deli container, and then use it per serving with fresh cooked pasta.

# Ingredients
- 1 lb spaghetti ***- [1]***
- Olive oil (enough to cover the bottom of the pan)
- 4 cloves garlic (minced)
- 1 2 oz can of anchovies
- 1 6 oz bottle of kalamata olives
    - strain and reserve juice for later
- 1 3.5 fl oz bottle of capers
- 1 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes
- 1 bundle of Italian parsley (finely chopped)
- salt & pepper (to taste)
- pecorino romano (however much you want)

# Instructions
1. Cook pasta al dente per box instructions, remember to salt the water. After this is done reserve some of the pasta water, strain, and chill the noodles. Set aside.
1. In a large sauce pan on medium heat, add olive oil, garlic, and anchovies. Sautee until anchovies have dissolved.
1. Squeeze and add olives to pan. Add the capers. Sautee for another couple minutes.***- [2]***
1. While all of that is sauteing in the pan, in a bowl add the tomatoes, parsley, and black pepper. Mix. After the sauce ingredients are done sauteing, add the tomatoes to the sauce pan. Add salt to taste and bring to a simmer.
1. Add noodles and toss until combined. Bring to a simmer and cook for another minute.***- [3]***
1. Serve in bowl, garnish with pecorino romano.

1. You can opt for not making a whole pound of pasta, just making it by the serving. You can then ladle in however much sauce you think is necessary for the amount of pasta you've cooked and mix the pasta in. It tastes better like this instead of reheating it by the serving. If you store it and reheat it you might find the noodles to be a little bloated from sitting in a watery and acidic sauce for so long.
1. Pretty much just grab the olives handfulls at a time and aggressively squeeze them over the pan. This adds more flavor to the dish. Add the olives themselves after squeezing.
1. If the sauce isn't sticking to the noodles or you think it's a bit too loose add some of the reserved pasta water and simmer for a while longer to thicken and help it stick to the noodles.
