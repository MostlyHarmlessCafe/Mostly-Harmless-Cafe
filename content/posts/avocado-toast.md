This recipe is for a single serving. If you want to make a small meal out of it you could probably make do with making two servings. The hollandaise in this recipe is enough for about three servings on its own in case you're either making additional servings or just really like drowning your brunch in sauce.

    - 1 slice of whole grain bread
    - 1 egg (poached)
    - 2 slices of tomato (&frac18; inch thick, generously salted and peppered)
    - 1 slice of bacon (halved)
- Avocado:
    - 1 avocado (smashed)
    - &frac12; tbsp lime juice
    - &frac14; jalapeno (finely diced)
    - a pinch of cilantro
    - salt and pepper to taste
- Hollandaise sauce:
    - 3 egg yolks
    - &frac12; cup of butter (melted)
    - 1 tbsp of dijon mustard
    - 1 tbsp of lemon juice
    - 1 tsp of cayenne pepper
        - reserve additional for garnish
    - salt to taste

## Instructions:

## Footnotes
{{< footnote "1" "After being added to the thermos the hollandaise will keep for about an hour, more or less. Furthermore, if you find that you made the hollandaise a little too thick you can add a drop or two (and only that) of water to it and swirl it around and it will loosen the sauce up." >}}
