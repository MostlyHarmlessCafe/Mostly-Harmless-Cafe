Similar to the spaghetti and meatballs dish, this started as a "But Cheaper" item from Joshua Weissman. Similar to the spaghetti, I added a sofrito, anchovies, and a bit of other things to make it a bit more aromatic and savory.

# Ingredients
- 9 lasagna noodles
- Sauce:
    - 1 Tbsp of clarified butter
        - subst: vegetable oil
    - 1 lb ground beef
    - &frac12; lb italian sausage
    - 1 small onion (finely diced)
    - 1 carrot (finely diced)
    - 1 celery stalk (finely diced)
    - 1 oz of anchovies
    - 1 tsp fennel seeds (ground)
    - 4 oz tomato paste
    - 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes
    - 2 cloves of garlic (minced)
- Cheese Mixture:
    - 15 oz ricotta
    - 1 egg
    - &frac14; cup of pecorino romano
    - 8 oz low-moisture mozzarella cheese ***- [1]***
    - salt & pepper

# Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 375&deg;F
1. Cook noodles per box instructions (don't forget to salt water). Cool with cold water and set aside when done.
1. In a large pot on medium-high heat, melt the butter and place ground beef and sausage. Mash the meat in and let rest for 1m30s. Flip and do the same with the other side.
1. Add onions, celery, and carrot to the pot and cook until onions are translucent.
1. Add fennel seed, anchovies, and garlic to the ground beef. 
1. Add tomato paste, stir until combined.
1. Add in the crushed tomatoes. Let simmer for about 10 minutes.
1. In a medium bowl combine the pecorino romano, ricotta, mozzarella, and egg with a generous amount of salt and pepper.
1. In a 9&frac12;x11-inch baking pan, lay a fourth of your meat sauce mix followed by layer made by laying 3 cooked noodles.
1. Next, add a fourth of the meat sauce, followed by a third of the cheese mix, followed by another 3 noodles.
1. Repeat previous step.
1. Put the remainder of your meat sauce followed by the remainder of your cheese sauce.
    - optional: garnish with additional mozzarella
1. Cover and place in oven for 25 minutes.
1. Uncover and place in oven for another 25 minutes. ***- [2]***
1. Remove from oven and let sit for 15 minutes.

# Footnotes
1. No pre-shredded cheese. It's also recommended that you use low-moisture mozzarella. If you use something like buffalo mozzarella it will make the layer flat and soggy rather than stringy.
1. Feel free to broil on high for a minute or two to get that browning on the top. Be careful not to brown it too much because it might make the top layer of cheese a bit chewy and difficult to work with.
