This recipe calls for noodles but the sauce can be put on pretty much everything from bread to potatoes. It's best served topped with sour cream and garnished with parsley. This recipe is enough for roughly a pound of dry egg noodles but it's recommended that you make it to keep and make the noodles per serving. Sauce keeps really well, cooked noodles not so much.

# Ingredients
- Rub/Marinade
    - &frac12; tbsp of salt
    - &frac12; tbsp of black peppercorns
    - &frac12; tbsp of whole allspice
    - 1 tsp of fennel seeds
    - 2 cloves of garlic (minced)
- Beef Stroganoff
    - 1&frac12; lbs thin sliced chuck (~&frac14;inch) ***- [1]***
    - &frac14; cup butter (div. 2)
    - 1 medium yellow onion (sliced)
    - 1 lb bella mushrooms (sliced)
    - 4 cloves garlic (minced)
    - &frac12; cup vegetable stock and 1 tbsp white vinegar (mixed together)
    - 2 cups beef stock
    - 1 tbsp worcestershire sauce
    - 3&frac12; tbsp all-purpose flour
    - &frac12; tbsp of fine salt
    - &frac12; tbsp of black pepper (ground)
    - &frac12; tbsp of whole allspice (ground)
    - &frac12; cup sour cream (plus additional for topping)
    - 1 tbsp mustard ***- [2]***

# Instructions
- Beef
    1. Toast pepper, allspice, and fennel seeds by heating in a pan and grind with salt in a mortar and pestle or grinder. Add garlic and grind to combine. Mix into the beef. Let sit for 30 minutes to an hour.
    1. Melt one of the divisions of butter in a dutch oven on medium heat and sear the beef therein (you may have to do this in batches as to not overcroud the pot). After all meat is seared take out meat and set aside.
- Sauce
    1. Mix together salt, pepper, and allspice and set aside.
    1. Reduce heat to medium-low and add the other division butter. After butter is melted add the sliced onions. Cook while occassionally mixing until all the onions are well caramelized and then add the mushrooms. Cook while occassionally stirring for another 2-3 minutes or until mushrooms soften.
    1. Add the garlic and stir for around 1 more minute.
    1. Increase heat to medium and add the stock and while it's deglazing scrape the remnants off the bottom of the pot. Cook for 3 minutes or until you can't smell the booze anymore.
    1. In a separate bowl, mix together the beef stock, flour, and Worcestershire sauce. Add this mixture to the dutch oven, stir to combine, and bring to a simmer.
    1. Add beef, stir to combine, and let simmer for 20-30 minutes.
    1. Season to taste with salt, pepper, and allspice mixture.
    1. Add in the sour cream and optional mustard and stir to combine.
    1. Serve with pasta, mashed potatoes, rice, or whatever else you'd like.

# Footnotes
1. The reason for using chuck is mainly because it's cheap and for me that makes the dish more down to earth. I also like that you'll come across a chunk of fat every so often. You can use sirloin, ribeye, ground beef, or whatever cut of beef you want. Whatever you use, the meat will tenderize the longer you simmer it. Careful not to boil because that will have the opposite effect.
1. The mustard adds a bit of brightness and acidity which complements the dish's richness. Any type of mustard works but I like using classic yellow mustard; furthermore, what I usually do is omit the mustard altogether and add it per serving since how much mustard I want usually varies.
